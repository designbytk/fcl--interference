For maximum impact, get a car wrap with a custom design by **Auto Trim Design** and have a mobile billboard for your company, allowing you to reach customers you hadn't been able to reach before. Bring your company car to tradeshows, events, crowded malls and beaches, anywhere you go you will get noticed with a vehicle wrap.    
  
Vehicle wraps are a low cost alternative to other forms of advertising, like radio ads, magazines, pay per click campaigns, that only give you temporary exposure in limited areas.  A vehicle wrap can be driven anywhere to target specific groups and your wrap will stay looking new for years.  It's a one time investment that pays you back for years to come.
